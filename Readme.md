## Description

This project is an application where users can register to provide feedback on a product. They can also comment on other users’ suggestions and reply to comments and upvote suggestions. This application was made using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, NodeJS, ExpressJS and running on a. MongoDB database. I also used Cloudinary to store user photos

To comment on other user’s feedback and reply to comments you can select individual feedbacks and see other comments and replies and to add your own comment type in a comment at the bottom and click Post Comment button.
