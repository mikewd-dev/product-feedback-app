# Product Feedback App

![License Badge](https://shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

## Overview

The **Product Feedback App** is a full-stack web application where users can submit feedback on products, comment on other users’ suggestions, reply to comments, and upvote ideas. This project demonstrates my skills in **Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Bootstrap, Cloudinary**, and **frontend-backend integration**.  

I built this project as a self-directed project to showcase real-world full-stack development, including **database design, user authentication, dynamic UI, and API integration**.
